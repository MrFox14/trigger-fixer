# trigger-fixer

Yeah, I'm doing this now. This is a chrome extension that allows you to:
* input words that may cause you upset, and choose what to replace them with
* delete these words from your list
* it can therefore be used to remove your deadname, should you be so inclined

Pretty cool, right?

Emmey contributed a bunch behind the scenes, everyone say thank you Emmey (I, Emmey, have created this port, based on Echo's original design :3)
